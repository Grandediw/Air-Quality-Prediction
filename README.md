# AIR QUALITY PREDICTOR üåçüí®  

**Air Quality Predictor** is an advanced machine learning system designed to forecast air quality levels at **Serso via dei Caduti**, leveraging a feature store for integrated batch and real-time data pipelines. Inspired by O'Reilly's *Building Machine Learning Systems with a Feature Store: Batch, Real-Time, and LLMs*, this project demonstrates the power of scalable and interactive ML systems.

## üìå Pipeline Overview  

The pipeline integrates:
- **Data Collection**: Automated retrieval of historical and real-time weather and air quality data.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning, aggregation, and transformation for ML readiness.
- **Feature Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of engineered features via a feature store.
- **Model Predictions**: Batch and real-time forecasts using an XGBoost regressor.
